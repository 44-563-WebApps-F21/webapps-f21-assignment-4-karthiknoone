    <pre>			ACT I
<p>The Market Place of Padua at noon</p>
<p><h6>GUIDO</h6></p><p>I think it must be here.<p>[_Goes up to passer-by and doffs his cap_]</p>
Pray, sir, is this the market place, and that the church of SantaCroce?<p>[_Citizen bows_]</p>I thank you, sir</p>
<p><h6>ASCANIO</p></h6>
<p>Well?</p>
<p><h6>GUIDO</h6></p>
<p>Ay! it is here.</p>
<p><h6>ASCANIO</p></h6>
<p>I would it were somewhere else, for I see no wine-shop.</p>
<p><h6>GUIDO</p></h6>
<p>[_Taking a letter from his pocket and reading it_.]</p><p>‘The hour noon;
the city, Padua; the place, the market; and the day, Saint Philip’s
Day.’</p>
<p><h6>ASCANIO</p></h6>
<p>And what of the man, how shall we know him?</p>
<p><h6>GUIDO</p></h6> <p>[_reading still_]</p>
<p>‘I will wear a violet cloak with a silver falcon broidered on the
shoulder.’ A brave attire, Ascanio.</p>
<p><h6>ASCANIO</p></h6>
<p>I’d sooner have my leathern jerkin. And you think he will tell you of
your father?</p>
<p><h6>GUIDO</p></h6>
<p>Why, yes! It is a month ago now, you remember; I was in the vineyard,
just at the corner nearest the road, where the goats used to get in, a
man rode up and asked me was my name Guido, and gave me this letter,
signed ‘Your Father’s Friend,’ bidding me be here to-day if I would
know the secret of my birth, and telling me how to recognise the
writer! I had always thought old Pedro was my uncle, but he told me
that he was not, but that I had been left a child in his charge by
some one he had never since seen.
</p>
<p><h6>ASCANIO</p></h6>
<p>And you don’t know who your father is?
</p>
<p><h6>GUIDO</p></h6>
<p>No.
</p>
<p><h6>ASCANIO</p></h6>
<p>No recollection of him even?
</p>
<p><h6>GUIDO</p></h6>
<p>None, Ascanio, none.
</p>
<p><h6>ASCANIO</p></h6> <p>[_laughing_]</p>
<p>Then he could never have boxed your ears so often as my father did
mine.
</p>
<p><h6>GUIDO</p></h6> <p>[_smiling_]</p>
<p>I am sure you never deserved it.
</p>
<p><h6>ASCANIO</p></h6>
<p>Never; and that made it worse. I hadn’t the consciousness of guilt to
buoy me up. What hour did you say he fixed?
