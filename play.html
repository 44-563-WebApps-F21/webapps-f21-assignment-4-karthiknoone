    <pre>			ACT I
<p class="speech">The Market Place of Padua at noon</p>
<p><h6 class="GUIDO">GUIDO</h6></p><p class="speech">I think it must be here.</p><p class="stage-direction">[_Goes up to passer-by and doffs his cap_]</p>
<p class="speech">Pray, sir, is this the market place, and that the church of SantaCroce?<p class="stage-direction">[_Citizen bows_]</p>I thank you, sir</p>
<p><h6 class="ASCANIO">ASCANIO</h6></p>
<p class="speech">Well?</p>
<p><h6 class="GUIDO">GUIDO</h6></p>
<p class="speech">Ay! it is here.</p>
<p><h6 class="ASCANIO">ASCANIO</h6></p>
<p class="speech">I would it were somewhere else, for I see no wine-shop.</p>
<p><h6 class="GUIDO">GUIDO</h6></p>
<p class="stage-direction">[_Taking a letter from his pocket and reading it_.]</p><p class="speech">‘The hour noon;
the city, Padua; the place, the market; and the day, Saint Philip’s
Day.’</p>
<p><h6 class="ASCANIO">ASCANIO</h6></p>
<p class="speech">And what of the man, how shall we know him?</p>
<p><h6 class="GUIDO">GUIDO</h6></p> <p class="stage-direction">[_reading still_]</p>
<p class="speech">‘I will wear a violet cloak with a silver falcon broidered on the
shoulder.’ A brave attire, Ascanio.</p>
<p><h6 class="ASCANIO">ASCANIO</h6></p>
<p class="speech">I’d sooner have my leathern jerkin. And you think he will tell you of
your father?</p>
<p><h6 class="GUIDO">GUIDO</h6></p>
<p class="speech">Why, yes! It is a month ago now, you remember; I was in the vineyard,
just at the corner nearest the road, where the goats used to get in, a
man rode up and asked me was my name Guido, and gave me this letter,
signed ‘Your Father’s Friend,’ bidding me be here to-day if I would
know the secret of my birth, and telling me how to recognise the
writer! I had always thought old Pedro was my uncle, but he told me
that he was not, but that I had been left a child in his charge by
some one he had never since seen.
</p>
<p><h6 class="ASCANIO">ASCANIO</h6></p>
<p class="speech">And you don’t know who your father is?
</p>
<p><h6 class="GUIDO">GUIDO</h6></p>
<p class="speech">No.
</p>
<p><h6 class="ASCANIO">ASCANIO</h6></p>
<p class="speech">No recollection of him even?
</p>
<p><h6 class="GUIDO">GUIDO</h6></p>
<p class="speech">None, Ascanio, none.
</p>
<p><h6 class="ASCANIO">ASCANIO</h6></p> <p class="stage-direction">[_laughing_]</p>
<p class="speech">Then he could never have boxed your ears so often as my father did
mine.
</p>
<p><h6 class="GUIDO">GUIDO</h6></p> <p class="stage-direction">[_smiling_]</p>
<p class="speech">I am sure you never deserved it.
</p>
<p><h6 class="ASCANIO">ASCANIO</h6></p>
<p class="speech">Never; and that made it worse. I hadn’t the consciousness of guilt to
buoy me up. What hour did you say he fixed?
